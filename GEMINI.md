# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of Python learning materials. It includes a series of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that cover fundamental programming concepts. The files are organized numerically, suggesting a curriculum-like progression.

## Key Files

*   `codes/01_Variable_string.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook covering Python strings and variables.
*   `codes/02_variables_List.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook explaining Python lists.
*   `codes/03_variables_dic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook on Python dictionaries.
*   `codes/04_variables_bundle.ipynb` & `codes/04_variables_bundles_more.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks about tuples and other data structures.
*   `codes/05_ifs.py`: Python script demonstrating conditional `if` statements.
*   `06_whiles.py`: Python script demonstrating `while` loops.

## Usage

This directory is intended for learning and practicing basic Python programming. The Jupyter notebooks can be run in a Jupyter environment to interactively explore the concepts, while the Python scripts can be executed directly.
